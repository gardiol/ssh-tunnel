This is a bash script that can create for you resilient SSH tunnels from your home server to one or more extern.

Check the conf/tunnel.conf file and adapt to your needs.

Create one or more "tunnel" files under the tunnels folder.
For example call this "external-server":
REMOTE_SERVER=99.99.99.99
REMOTE_SERVER_SSH_PORT=222 # remote-server SSH port
HOME_SERVER_REMOTE_SSH_PORT=2022 # home-server SSH port mapped on remote server
#SSH_IDENTITY=/root/.ssh/id_rsa.tunnel #optional, if you need a different SSH identity
#REMOTE_USER=tunnel # optional remote server username if different from local server username.

# note: SSH remote access is created automatically, no need to specify it below.

# tunnels for home access from remote
REMOTE_TO_HOME=\
"127.0.0.1:8080:127.0.0.1:80"\
"127.0.0.1:8443:127.0.0.1:8443"

# tunnels for remote access from home
HOME_TO_REMOTE=
